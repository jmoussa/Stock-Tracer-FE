# Stock Tracer Front-End

This is the front-end Vue.js build for the Stock Tracer.
Currently Stock Tracer only links up with Robinhood users (and if you have 2-factor authentication, it needs to be via a 3rd party application like Okta, Authenticator, etc.)

## Supercharge Your Online Financial Dashboards

By linking with Robinhood (and more online brokerages, comming soon) Stock Tracer is able to give you additional insights and metrics via interactive dashboards showcasing:

- Our default Historical Stock Price Timeline
- Earnings per Quarter View & additional stock info
- MACD + Signal Line Graphs
- Dividend Timeline (coming soon)
